# Currently, MSI has USEARCH version 8.1.1756. The current pipeline is for version 9.2, which you can add to your home directory.

# I (Patrick) have downloaded USEARCH 9.2 and put it in a folder called "Programs" in my directory. If you're part of the jordannr lab group, 
# you can add it to your user profile to access it from the command line. If you're not part of the jordannr lab group, download it yourself
# follow the directions for adding it to your path.

########################
# For lab group members:
nano ~/.profile  # open the `.profile` configuration file in nano text editor

# at the bottom of the file, add the following lines:
if [ -d "/home/jordannr/ewing069/Programs" ] ; then
        PATH="$PATH:/home/jordannr/ewing069/Programs"
fi

# Save and exit.
# test by typing:
usearch9  # to distinguish from usearch8.1, which is already available on MSI but lacks some features.

########################
# For non-lab group members:
# From your terminal (unix, requires `rsync`)
rsync -e ssh -avz local_path_to/usearch username@login.msi.umn.edu:/home/group/username
# For windows, use `scp`. See MSI FAQs: https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/support/faq/how-do-i-use-winscp-transfer-data

# Then, ssh in to MSI
# Add the path to usearch to your $PATH so you can execute it
nano ~/.profile  # edit your .profile configuration file
# Add the following to the end of the file
if [ -d "$HOME/path_to_usearch" ] ; then
        PATH="$PATH:$HOME/path_to_usearch"
fi

# make it executable
cd ~/path_to_usearch
# rename if desired
mv old_usearch_name new_usearch_name
chown 770 new_usearch_name  # gives entire group permissions to read/write/execute.
